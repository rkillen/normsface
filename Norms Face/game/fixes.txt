Fixes:

Marble
 book should close before "He closes the book."
 "Maybe I should take a little less 'me time' and a little more 'we time'," Norm considered.

Alabaster
 improve the contala script

Coda
 piano fades too quickly during the revisit
 the "You know, I think I did" line is still clumsy




Optimizations

Make paths clickable

Alabaster
 add more context to menu items, to match other paths
