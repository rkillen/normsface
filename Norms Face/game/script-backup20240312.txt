    "A couple of seagulls, preening in the quiet surf, were surprised by his sudden appearance, but even more surprised by the three paths of stone abruptly rising around them."

    "A chain of smooth black marble pointed a little to the left. Alabaster gleamed like a ribbon of snow on the right. And in the middle, a path of speckled, gray granite led straight to the horizon."

    "The gulls flew off in a huff."

    "\"Huh,\" Norm thought. He might have come up with more thoughts, but at that particular moment, he was distracted by the song that was still playing in his head, apparently on loop. It was soft and simple and reminded him of a lovely, light shade of green he couldn’t quite name."
